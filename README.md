# Head First: Design Patterns Exercices
The goal of this repository is making to me understanding how different software design patterns work.


## Design Patterns
### Chapter One: Strategy
### Chapter Two: Observer
### Chapter Three: Decorator
## Development container
This project uses VS Code Remote - Containers extension.

A **development container** is a running [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. You can try out development containers with **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** or **[Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**.

This is a sample project that lets you try out either option in a few easy steps. We have a variety of other [vscode-remote-try-*](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Amicrosoft+vscode-remote-try-&type=Repositories) sample projects, too.

> **Note:** If you already have a Codespace or dev container, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.

### GitHub Codespaces
Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the Code drop-down menu and select the **Open with Codespaces** option.
1. Select **+ New codespace** at the bottom on the pane.

For more info, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace).

### VS Code Remote - Containers
If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).



### Things to try

Once you have this sample opened, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

> **Note:** This container runs as a non-root user with sudo access by default. Comment out `"remoteUser": "vscode"` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` if you'd prefer to run as root.

Some things to try:

1. **Edit:**
   - Open `src/main/java/{chapter}`.
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features.
   - Notice that the Java extension pack is already installed in the container since the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` lists `"vscjava.vscode-java-pack"` as an extension to install automatically when the container is created.
2. **Terminal:** Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and type `uname` and other Linux commands from the terminal window.
3. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Open `src/main/java/com/mycompany/app/App.java`.
   - Add a breakpoint.
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables, examining locals, and more.
4. **Run a Test:**
   - Open `src/test/java/com/mycompany/app/AppTest.java`.
   - Put a breakpoint in a test.
   - Click the `Debug Test` in the Code Lens above the function and watch it hit the breakpoint.
